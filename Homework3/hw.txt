When inserting the URL object into the multiset, the multiset must search itself to see if there are any previous
instances of that URL object in the multiset. It does this using the Multiset<T>::find(const URL& value) function.
In that function, there is a statement that checks if the URL objects in the multiset are not equal to the URL object
passed to the function. It is the statement

p->m_value != value

where p->m_value and value are both of type URL. This statement causes a compile error because the operator !=
is not defined for objects of the type URL.
